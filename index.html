        <p>My name is Ryan Foss. I currently work at the IT Help Desk for a large insurance company. As much as I enjoy the
            many challenges and surprises that await me on the other end of the phone on the calls I take every day, I hope
            to become a software developer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have a BA in Sociology and I went back to school a few years ago to get a second Bachelor's degree in IT. I took
            a number of programming while completing my second degree and I am looking forward to building on those skills
            and completing more projects. </p>
